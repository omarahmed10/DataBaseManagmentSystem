# DataBaseManagmentSystem
	A Computer Database is a structured collection of records or data that is stored in
a computer system. On the other hand, a Database Management System (DBMS)
is a complex set of software programs that controls the organization, storage,
management, and retrieval of data in a database. DBMS are categorized
according to their data structures or types. The DBMS accepts requests for data
from the application program and instructs the operating system to transfer the
appropriate data. On the other hand, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a set
of rules for encoding documents in machine readable form. It is defined in the
XML 1.0 Specification produced by the W3C, and several other related
specifications, all gratis open standards.
# JDBC API Implementation
	Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) provides Java developers with a standard API
that is used to access databases, regardless of the driver and database product.
